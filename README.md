# Create: Garnished v0.6 - Overhauled!

## Getting Started/Finding your first nut(s)
**Nut Growths** will not be removed from pre-existing worlds, but will no longer generate past already generated chunks.

You can instead find **Nut Trees** which (functionally) act the same as **Nut Growths**, just making more logical sense. Again, gameplay-wise, not much changes. These trees will occasionally have leaves that, upon being broken, will drop a random nut from the available/current 8.

## Reproduction/Automation of Nuts
Again, gameplay-wise, it is not drastically different and would act similarly to a basic tree farm.

Each nut (mostly) provides a unique trunk/leaf structure, so this could either not affect the design of your farm, or it could heavily impact it to the point of a total redesign.

This also gets rid of the flaw that was Mechanical Harvesters automatically replanting nuts. You will have to now filter out some nuts to crush/crack open, to replant them as saplings.

## General Adjustments/Additions
**Cracked Nuts** will now act as saplings (as stated somewhat earlier) with their unique tree.

The crushing recipe for **Garnished Compound** has been adjusted once more to only bear a base total of 4 compounds alongside a 10% chance of 2 additional compounds.

The compacting recipe for **Solidified Garnish Blocks** has also been changed, requiring 3 sugar/sugarcane instead of the original 2, alongside now requiring 1 **Salt Compound**.

An additional nut will be added, **Hazelnuts**! While I wasn't planning on adding any more nuts, I felt that since this was an overhaul update, I might as well also look at community suggestions. Over here on Github, there aren't many suggestions currently circulating, if any. However, almost a week ago **Create: Garnished** was put into the spotlight on **[Dejojo's Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@dejojotheawsome)** (for those who may not know, the entire reason that this mod exists, is because of a stupid debacle that happened on a live stream of his). So I looked through the comments on the video and saw a decent few people enjoy the idea of hazelnuts being added that could be used in an alternative chocolate recipe.

**Melted Cinder Flour Nut** recipes that conflicted with Create/Vanilla recipes are now fixed! The recipe now requires **Garnish Powder** or **Salt Compound** instead of sugar and is also converted from a mixing recipe to a compacting recipe. If any other conflicts come up, feel free to open a report here or message me in some variation! (some other minor tweaks have also been made to this recipe)

**Salt Compound** will now be created via a sequenced assembly line recipe. Similar to the train track recipe, only requiring one full cycle. The first and second steps of the assembly require you to press it, and the final step requires you to apply **Garnish Compound** onto the item.

**Crushed Salt** now requires **Limestone** instead of all stones. This change was made due to other conflictions regarding crushing recipes being automatically generated.

As a byproduct of other changes, **Botany Pots** Compatibility will also be removed. This may be changed in the future, as **Botany Trees** exists, and compatibility may come along. This is unlikely, however.


More information may be added in the future, but until then, thank you so much for all of the support on this mod! (Please report any issues/suggestions here, and if you have questions, feel free to ask them!)
